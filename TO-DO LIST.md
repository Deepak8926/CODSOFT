This is a Command-line To-Do list python programming.
I used VS-Code or Visual Studio code as editor to run this program.
I used Python 3.11 application as an interpreter.
Many websites and youtube videos helped me to develop this code.
I gained little more experienced about python programming code due to this project.
I am looking forward to the next task of this internship.
Thank you CODSOFT.
